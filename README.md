# Computational Logic

“Computational Logic” refers to different areas of computer science in different communities.

For example, in the Symbolic Artificial Intelligence community, it can simply mean “Logic Programming.” In this context, it is seen as a methodology for modeling complex systems, but almost always of limited scope.

Alternatively, in the Formal Logic and Proof Theory community, it can refer to the automation of logical inference; for example, “theorem provers” are included in this interpretation. As such, it can be applied to complex logics (higher-order logics, temporal and modal logics, etc.), but the systems it describes also have a limited dimension.

This discipline seeks to 

> study methodologies and tools for modeling and verifying the logical properties of very large systems. 

In contrast, the logic used here is relatively simple: it is often limited to propositional logic.
